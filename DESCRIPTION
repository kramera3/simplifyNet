Description: An R package for network sparsification with a variety of novel and known network sparsification techniques. All network sparsification reduce the number of edges, not the number of nodes. A network is usually a large, complex weighted graph obtained from real-world data. It is commonly stored as an adjacency matrix or edge list. Network sparsification is sometimes referred to as network dimensionality reduction.
