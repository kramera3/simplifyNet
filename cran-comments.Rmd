This is the authors' first submission to CRAN.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added certain reused words to the user dictionary. 

* Edited the example of bestpath to have its running time <5s.


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were two NOTES that can be easily ignored:

* There were three possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION: Sparsification, simplifyNet, and sparsification. These three words are spelled correctly and are technical terms related to our methods or the package name.

* "Found the following files/directorie: 'lastMiKTeXException'" is a documented problem with MiKTeX and has no influence over the compilation of simplifyNet or its documentation. 

## Downstream dependencies

No packages are dependencies of simplifyNet.
